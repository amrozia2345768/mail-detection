# mail-detection
Build a machine learning model to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam, helping prevent phishing and junk emails.
What I Learned:
Text cleaning & preprocessing
TF-IDF Vectorization
Naive Bayes model training
Model deployment using Streamlit
Creating dashboards (Confusion Matrix, Pie Charts) 
 Project Features:
Real-time Email Classification (Spam/Not Spam)
Interactive Dashboard with Visuals (Pie Chart, WordCloud, Confusion Matrix)
Background Customization with Clean UI (Streamlit app)
Model Deployment for live predictions
Phishing and Spam Text Handling (Extendable Model)
Dataset Used:
 Spam/Ham dataset (Book4.xlsx)
v1 → Label (Spam/Ham)
v2 → Message (Email text)
Tools & Libraries:
 Python | Pandas | scikit-learn | Streamlit | Matplotlib  | Joblib
